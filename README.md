# backend-ai-challenge
intensive architectural pivot: Building high-integrity data systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) AI, and scalable backend infrastructure
🏗️ The Mission

To master the professional backend lifecycle and the "AI Stack," building systems that don't just display data, but "think" using custom retrieval systems.
📅 Progress Tracker
1: The Backend Architect

Goal: Move from "visual sites" to "data integrity."

2: The AI Engineer

Goal: Build systems that "think" using custom data.

    Key Focus: Prompt Engineering, Vector Databases (ChromaDB), and RAG Foundation.

3: The System Architect

Goal: Handle the entire product lifecycle from database to deployment.

    Key Focus: CI/CD, Error Monitoring (Sentry), and the "Exit Strategy".
